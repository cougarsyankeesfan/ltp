# ltp
LTP contains the program files I created while studying Ruby through “Learn to Program” by Chris Pine. 

For many of the exercises of the book, I’ve changed the code slightly so I could better understand what is going on. 

Each file name will end with a number. This represents the chapter in the book that I was in when I wrote the program.

Moving forward I'll comment start the program with comments to provide context to what's happening.
